Legal Thriller Writing Made Easy
by Dave Barry, June 21, 1993.

Like most people, I can always use an extra 7 or 8 million dollars, which
is why today I have decided to write a blockbuster legal thriller.

Americans buy legal thrillers by the ton.  I was in many airports over the
past few months, and I got the impression the aviation authorities were
making this announcement over the public-address system: FEDERAL 
REGULATIONS PROHIBIT YOU FROM BOARDING A PLANE UNLESS YOU ARE CARRYING 
"THE CLIENT" BY JOHN GRISHAM.  I mean, EVERYBODY had this book.  ("This
is the captain speaking.  We'll be landing in Seattle instead of Detroit
because I want to finish "The Client."")

The ironic thing is that best-selling legal thrillers generally are
written by lawyers, who are not famous for written communication.  I cite
as Exhibit A my own attorney, Joseph DiGiacinto, who is constantly
providing me with shrewd, well-reasoned advice that I cannot understand
because Joe has taken the legal precaution of translating it into Martian.

Consider his faxes.  Usually, when people send you a fax, they send a
cover page on top of it, which conveys the following information:  "Here's
a fax for (your name)."  But Joe's cover page features a statement
approximately the length of the United States Constitution, worded so
legally that I can't look directly at it without squinting.  It says
something like:  "WARNING: The following document and all appurtenances
thereto and therein are the sole and exclusionary property of the
aforementioned (hereinafter "The Mortgagee") and may not be read, touched,
spindled, fondled or rebroadcast without the expressively written consent
of Major League Baseball, subject to severe legal penalties (hereinafter
"The Blowtorch Noogie") this means YOU."

And that's just Joe's COVER PAGE.  Nobody has ever dared to read one of
his actual faxes, for fear of being immediately thrown into prison.  This
is typical of United States legal correspondence, the primary purpose of
which is to scare everybody who comes into contact with it into immediately
hiring a lawyer.

Nevertheless, some lawyers are hugely successful writers, and I intend to
cash in on this.  I am not, technically, a lawyer, but I did watch
numerous episodes of "Perry Mason," and on one occasion, when I got a
traffic ticket, I represented myself in court, successfully pleading
"nolo contendre" (Latin, meaning "Can I pay by check?").  So I felt
well-qualified to write the following blockbuster legal thriller and
possible movie screenplay:

CHAPTER ONE

The woman walked into my office, and I instantly recognized her as
Clarissa Fromage, charged with murdering her late husband, wealthy
industrial polluter A. Cranston "Bud" Fromage, whose death was originally
reported as a heart attack, but later ruled a homicide when sophisticated
laboratory tests showed that his head had been cut off.

"So," she said, and I could tell by the way she spoke the word that it
had quotation marks around it.  "You're a young Southern lawyer resembling
a John Grisham protagonist as much as possible without violating the 
copyright laws."

"That's right," I replied.  "Perhaps we can have sex."

"Not in the first chapter," she said.

CHAPTER TWO

"Ohhhhhhh," she cried out.  "OOOHMIGOD."

"I'm sorry," I said, "but that's my standard hourly fee."

CHAPTER THREE

The courtroom tension was so palpable that you could feel it.

"Detective Dungman," said the district attorney, "please tell the jury
exactly what you found inside of the defendant's purse on the night of
the murder.

"Tic-Tacs," said Dungman.

"Was there anything else?"

"No, I can't think of ... Wait a minute.  Now that you mention it, there
was something."

"What was it?"

"A chainsaw."

A murmur ran through the courtroom and, before the bailiff could grab it,
jumped up and bit Judge Webster M. Tuberhonker on the nose.

"That's going to hurt," I told my client.

CHAPTER FOUR

With time running out on the case, we returned to my office for a scene
involving full frontal nudity.

CHAPTER FIVE

A hush fell over the courtroom, injuring six, as I approached the witness.

"Dr. Feldspar," I said.  "You are an expert, are you not?"

"Yes," he answered.

"And you are familiar with the facts of this case, are you not?"

"Yes."

"And you are aware that, as a trained attorney, I can turn statements into
questions by ending them with "are you not," are you not?"

"Yes."

"And is it not possible that, by obtaining genetic material from fossils,
scientists could clone NEW dinosaurs?"

"OBJECTION!" thundered the district attorney.  "He's introducing the plot
from the blockbuster science thriller and motion picture "Jurassic Park"!"

The judge frowned at me over his spectacles.  "In the movie," he said, "whom
do you see playing the defendent in Chapter Four?"

"Sharon Stone," I answered.

"I'll allow it," he said.

CHAPTER SIX

"And so, ladies and gentlemen of the jury," I said, "only ONE PERSON could
have committed this murder, and that person is ..."

The guilty party suddenly jumped up, causing the courtroom to nearly spit
out its chewing gum.

"THAT'S RIGHT!" the guilty party shouted.  "I DID IT, AND I'M GLAD!"

It was Amy Fisher.
